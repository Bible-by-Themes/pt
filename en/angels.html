 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virginâ€™s name
was Mary.
 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail,
thou that art
 highly favoured, the Lord
is with thee: blessed
art
 thou among women.
 And when she saw
him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.
 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.
 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.
 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:
 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.
 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?
 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.
 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.
 For with God nothing shall be impossible.
 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.
</li><li>Matthew 1:20 â€“ But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.
</li><li>Daniel 9:21-23 â€“ Yea, whiles I
was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.
 And he informed
me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding.
 At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to shew
thee; for thou
art greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision.

 They shall bear thee up in
their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.
</li><li>Daniel 6:22 â€“ My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.
</li><li>Acts 12:7-11 â€“ And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon
him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from
his hands.
 And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.
 And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.
 When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.
 And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and
from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.

 His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:
 And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead
men.
 And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.
 He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
 And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.
